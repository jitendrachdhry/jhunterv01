> A Graph in the data structure can be termed as a data structure consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges(paths) and vertices (nodes), which are interconnected. Graph data structure (N, E) is structured with a collection of Nodes and Edges. Both nodes and vertices need to be finite.

With this n number of vertices must be attached to each of other vertices using the edges. It is also known as a full graph, and the degree of each vertex must be n-1.                                                                                                                                                                            | ![img_5.png](images/img_5.png)                                                                                      |

| 10      | Labelled Graph                  | A graph G= (V, E) is said to be a labelled or weighted graph because each of the edges in the graph holds some value or weight that denotes traversal cost through that edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![img_8.png](images/img_8.png)                                                                                      |
| 11      | Digraph Graph                   | A graph is said to a digraph or directed graph in case the order of pair of vertices changes the meaning of the graph. i.e. in case, G=(V, E) is the graph and Vi, Vj is a par of vertices is different from Vj, Vi. This can be seen in road maps when one of the roads is unidirectional or one-way. To denote such kind of cases directed graph is used. For each edge e between (Vi, Vj), an arrow exists to denote its direction. | ![img_9.png](images/img_9.png)                                                                                      |
| 12      | Subgraph                        | A graph G1 =(Vx, Ex) is said to be a subgraph of G=(V, E) if Vx ⊆ V and Ex ⊆ E.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ![img_10.png](images/img_10.png) ![img_11.png](images/img_11.png)                                                   |
| 13      | Connected or Disconnected Graph | In case one can find a path from one vertex of the graph to any of the other vertex, then the graph is said to be a connected graph. Thus a null graph is said to a disconnected graph as there is no edge connecting the vertices.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | (A) – Connected Graph![img_12.png](images/img_12.png) <br>(B) – Disconnected Graph ![img_13.png](images/img_13.png) |
| 14      | Directed Acyclic Graph          | It’s also known as DAG, these are the graphs with directed edges, but they do not contain any cycle. Vertices also hold some data, and as it is directed; thus, edges are represented using an ordered pair of vertices.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ![img_14.png](images/img_14.png)                                                                                    |
| 15      | Bipartite Graph                 | A bipartite graph also called a bi-graph, is a set of graph vertices, i.e, points where multiple lines meet, decomposed into two disjoint sets, meaning they have no element in common, such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.                                                                                                                                                                              | ![img.png](images/img.png)                                                                                                 |
