    /*
        Given a binary tree, write an efficient algorithm to check if it has a symmetric structure or not,
        i.e., left and right subtree mirror each other.

        Return true if
        1. Both trees are non-empty, and
        2. The left subtree is the mirror of the right subtree, and
        3. The right subtree is the mirror of the left subtree

        For example, the following are some binary trees that have a symmetric structure:
              1
            /   \
          2       3
           \     /
            5   6
     */
